    <h2>Know It All Ninja</h2>
    <p>To get prepared for the exam we was using a website called Know It All Ninja. On the website we had games to play that was teaching us how to answer the exam questions. There was also revision for each subject that would come up in my exam. After I did the revision I was answering questions to see if I have remembered what I read. When I answered all the questions correct I was getting points and then my teacher could see what I know and what I need to work on.
